* What needs to be done

** TODO Fix utf8

   Seems like all utf8 input is broken. WTF??

** TODO Drawing trees
   SCHEDULED: <2013-04-20 So>

   Use [[http://d3js.org/][D3js.org]]

   Try not to trash everything I already have.
   Also consider dropping Coffescript

** DONE Fix API to support angular resources
   SCHEDULED: <2013-04-15 Po>

   Url format should be *api/resource/:id/?:action*
   Where resource is in plural form. Nice fluent urls sucks for API.

   Rewrite everything to use $res->data instead of params and remove
   parametres encoding form Angular.

   Consider using [[http://apiary.io][Apiary]] for testing and documentation

** DONE Fix scenario CRUD
   SCHEDULED: <2013-04-16 Ãšt>

   The scenario CRUD is still /not complete/ - at least on the fronted side.
